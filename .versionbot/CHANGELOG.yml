                This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel
                patch backported

                from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when secure boot

                is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the kernel patch

                and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file that enables

                lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


                That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it and it adds

                extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no point keeping

                it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel to know

                whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back and rebase.

                In most cases there is not enough space on rootfs to extract

                and load a local hostapp image when the balena-host tmpdir

                is on the same partition.


                This uses a data mount to ensure temporary extracted files of the

                compressed image will not fill the target sysroot.

                The issue that this test is aimed at has been introduced in

                kernel versions above 4.13. On older kernels like for instance

                4.9, the test will not pass.


                Let's run this test on kernel versions where the issue was present.

                https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/1eee36a5520b5a89fb4d0d6af6f9cb0217a3164f

                was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,

                building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing

                headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible

                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the

                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the

                failed check in the above mentioned patch.


                Since we are not using the functions provided

                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this

                config.
