                This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel
                patch backported

                from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when secure boot

                is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the kernel patch

                and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file that enables

                lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


                That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it and it adds

                extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no point keeping

                it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel to know

                whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back and rebase.

                In most cases there is not enough space on rootfs to extract

                and load a local hostapp image when the balena-host tmpdir

                is on the same partition.


                This uses a data mount to ensure temporary extracted files of the

                compressed image will not fill the target sysroot.

                Under certain circumstances that we haven't reproduced,

                it is reported that the alternate GPT may become corrupt,

                preventing the device from booting.


                Should this happen, we use sgdisk to check and recover the end gpt

                from the main one.

                This caters for the use case of custom device types that are not

                registered in balena-cloud but still need to fetch the supervisor from

                balena-cloud's registry by querying the `supervisor_version` endpoint,

                for example when using openBalena.

                Providing the image name in the command line provides an update path

                for unmanaged devices, manual updates on ESR devices (which currently

                do not allow dashboard based updates) and openBalena use cases.

                was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,

                building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing

                headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible

                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the

                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the

                failed check in the above mentioned patch.


                Since we are not using the functions provided

                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this

                config.
